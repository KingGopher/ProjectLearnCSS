            <h2>A bit about each site</h2>
            <h3>YouTube and Spotify</h3>
            <p>
                I use YouTube daily, either as background noise or as a source of entertainment. I mostly watch <q>Lets plays</q>, though I hesitate to call them that<br>
                because it's less of a forced act and more genuine. It's also done live on Twitch and cut up and put on YoutTube. Spotify is a similar case, since it plays<br>
                exclusively music.
            </p>
            <h3>Discord and Messenger</h3>
            <p>
                These are both messaging sites (apps, really, but are sites displayed as a client) that I use to talk to family and friends back home. Discord also<br>
                has a plethora of memes and videos, along with being able to be used in a proffessional capacity.
            </p>
            <h3>Instagram</h3>
            <p>
                This is a site I use to pass the time. It is also used to talk to my brother and friends, but for the most part, I just use it to look at memes.
