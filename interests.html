            <h2>About My Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I don't really have all that many interests and what I do have I do a lot of. I spend as much time as I can on drawing, but gaming with friends is a<br>
                great way to releive stress so I end up doing that more than I would like. However, I do enough of each to get better little by little (except for<br>
                YouTube, I just watch that).
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been drawing for about a year now and I've made a signifigant amount of progress, and I wish I had started at a younger age so I could be even beter<br>
                than I am now. I started drawing because I used to be into 3d modeling but I couldn't make humans, so I was suggested to start drawing people to help<br>
                get better at it, I ended up having more fun with drawing. I've been into Computer science since 7th grade when I learned how to make Windows batch<br>
                files. I would make text-based adventure games for me and my brother. I then learned about modding minecraft, and decided to try it myself... I was<br>
                a little overwhelmed having never touched anything like Java before. So I went back and learned C# and that went way smoother. I moved on to Unity<br>
                and even went to HTML for a breif bit. In those 8 years though, I didn't learn half as much as I have here at Neumont.
