            <h2>Proffessional Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    After graduating from Neumont I plan on getting a job in Utah for a few years and building a resume from job to job. Eventually I want to work up to a larger<br>
                    company and become well known in it. There is a limit to who I will work for though, because many of silicon valley's company's go against my moral standards<br>
                    and as such I would have a hard time working for many of these companies.
                </p>
            <h2>Personal Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    For the first few year I would stay in the salt lake area to work here. I would like a proper house, but they seem either ludicrus in price or in a really poor<br>
                    neighborhood. So for time working in salt lake I would live in an apartment. After that though, I would like to live out in the country and work more from home<br>
                    and start a family. A few kids, a couple animals, and a lot of land to do as I please on.
