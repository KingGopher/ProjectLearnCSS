            <h2>School life</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Hello!</strong> I am an undergrad at Neumont College of Computer Science currently in my second quarter. I am currently undeclared but I will be along<br> 
                with the rest of my cohort in the third quarter, and as of right now I am torn between the web and cs degrees but hopefully I will be sure once third quarter rolls around. <br>
                At the moment I spend most of my time doing work and playing video games to pass the time. I don't go out much, but when I do I like to eat at the local <br>
                restaurants.
            </p>
            <h2>Home life</h2>
            <p>
                Back home I spent most of time going out with my friends, going out on drives and staying home to enjoy life and talk about the latest games and shows. <br>
                Occastionally I would go fishing with my uncle and dad, we wouldn't catch anything, but we barbecued and generally had a good time so it didn't matter. <br>
                I had a very quiet and uneventful life, let us just say I never got <em>carpe diem</em>. Nevertheless, I enjoy my life.
            </p>
